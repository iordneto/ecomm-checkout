# Implement Front-End Page

## Objective

Your assignment is to build the checkout front end of a checkout page.

Here we work with TypeScript, Next.js, Sass. It is not mandatory to use these tools for the test, but it is very important to keep it in mind.

### Step by Step:

- Reproduce the visual and behavioral elements presented in the provided reference in figma.
- Model a Mock API with dynamic data.
- Consume this Mock API in the front end. 

### Provided Resources

Here is the link to the layout in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/bGNgbhR5w3H5T0h9bJFkOe/%F0%9F%94%AE%5B-MISC-%5D-Frontent-test-reference-screens?node-id=9-4914&m=dev).

We don't provide a mock API; this is part of the test. 

#### Task 1: Create front Layout

- **Implement the components:** Analyze the image and identify which components need to be created (buttons, inputs, cards, lists, etc.).

  Faithfully reproduce the expected behavior of these components (styles, interactions, internal states, etc.).&#x20;

&#x20;

- **Organize the code:**Â Each component is independent and can be easily reused.&#x20;

- **Layout:** Ensure 80% fidelity; it does not need to be perfect, but it should have a high level of accuracy.

#### Task 2: Design and create an API

- **Model a mock API** with the data to be consumed in the front end. You can model it in any way you find most suitable for front-end consumption.

* Choose a tool to simulate the API (suggestions: JSON Server, MirageJS, or any other approach you prefer). Structure the data as you see fit (design endpoints, create routes, and define the format of each resource).

#### Task 3: Consume API from Front-end

- Make the front end dynamic and integrate it with the mock API.
- After building the API, ensure that the front end is able to consume the API's data and display it as expected on the screen.
